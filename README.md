# Programming3_Project

Project done in groups of 2 for the Programming 3 class at John Abbott College.

For our Programming 3 project, we had to create a simple quiz application using XAML. It was a group project done in teams of 2. The app would work by loading a text file with four questions and an answer in separate lines.

The format for the text file is as follows (witout the spaces between lines, those are due to Markdown formatting):

    Answer 1

    Answer 2

    Answer 3

    Answer 4

    Answer from above (ex: Answer 3)

This can be repeated as much as the user would like in order to have more questions.
